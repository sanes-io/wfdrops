# WFDrops

WFDrops is a web interface based on the Warframe Items API.
It allows you to search for items and see their drop locations and drop chances in the game.

The purpose of this project is to provide a quicker way to access the information than searching the Warframe Wiki, through a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Planned Features

- Search for any item in the game
  - Be provided with a list of drop locations and drop chances for the item
- Search for any mission in the game
  - Be provided with a list of items that can drop in the mission
